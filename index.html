        <b>Here is what we know about the impossible burger:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The Impossible burger was released in October 2018 by Burger King.</li>
            <li>The Impossible burger is vegetable burger which most resembles a hamburger.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Our total sales since 2016:</b><br>
            <div id="totalSales"></div><br>
            Circa 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter, 2018, we can see a somewhat linear groqth in terms of total sales for our company.
            Thus, until that time, our company is doing quite well. Post Q3, 2018, does not continue to reflect that growth.
            Instead, from that point on, sales drop and remain at that stagnent point. uncoincidentally, around the same time
            as the dip in sales, Burger King has released their vegetable burger. The had the sales only dipped for that quarter, 
            one would be able to argue that it was mereley the novelty of Burger King's new product that caused this dip. However,
            the fact that sales has remained stagenent at a lower level than before BK's burger was introduced, leads me to believe
            that consumers have taken a liking to the new concept. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>What happens to hamburger sales during the time the impossible burger is introduced?</b><br><br>
            The line chart below represents the sales trends of hamburgers by McDonald's <span>&#177;</span>1 month 
            from October each year. <br>
            <!-- Let's see the chart here-->
            <div id="lineChart"></div><br>
            September (<i style = 'color:#ffc72c'>yellow</i>) shows that from 2016 to 2018, hamburger sales increase year-by-year.
            This growth is backed by the step-ups that October (<i style = 'color:black'>black</i>) and November (<i style = 'color:#da291c'>red</i>) show until 2018.
            Thus we can infer that until September 2018, hamburger sales show growth. However, in October 2018, we see that
            instead of continuing the upwards growth of previous years, sales have fallen. This is also the same for November 2018
             and September 2019. It seems as though McDonald's hamburger sales have decreased from previous years beginning October 2018; 
             the same time in which Burger King has introduced the impossible burger. It would be possible to infer that 
              <b>BK's Impossible Burger could be stealing some of our potential business!!!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
                <b>What is our primary product?</b>
                <div id="pieChart"></div><br>
                To figure out a plan of action we want to first look at what our highest revenue generating stream is. From
                the chart above, we can see that hamburgers are the highest in terms of streams of revenue with the company.
                Because the fish fillet and the chicken fillet are both more health-conscious options and BK's burger is also a
                health-conscious hamburger alternative we would want to also go along those lines to take some of that market share
                and essentially beat them at their own game. The fact that our hamburgers still maintain such a high percentage of
                of our sales (<i>as shown below</i>) suggests that we must bolster hamburger sales as a whole or find an alternative
                much as Burger King has.<br>
                <div id="comparePieChart"></div><br>
                From the above two charts we can gather a few facts that can drive our decision-making process:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hamburgers, chicken fillets, and fish fillets maintain a roughly similar percentages of our total sales.</li>
                    <li>From 2018 to 2019, chicken and fish fillet sales percentages have slightly increased.</li>
                    <li>From 2018 to 2019, total sales in all categories nationwide have decreased.</li>
                </ul>
                With these in mind we can determine that holistically, McDonald's needs to make moves to expand our product line
                to include more health-conscious options for the customers. By introducing this these products, and incorporating 
                the brand loyalty that many already have with us, it would likely put us closer to generating revenue comparable
                to "pre-impossible burger" time.
